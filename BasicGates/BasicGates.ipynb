    "**Basic Gates** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed\n",
    "to get you familiar with the basic quantum gates in Q#.\n",
    "It covers the following topics:\n",
    "* basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates,\n",
    "* adjoint and controlled gates,\n",
    "* using gates to modify the state of a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.\n",
    "Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment)\n",
    "with some Q# code to make the failing test pass. To try your answer run the cell with Ctrl/⌘+Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tasks can be done using exactly one gate.\n",
    "None of the tasks require measurement, and the tests are written so as to fail if qubit state is measured.\n",
