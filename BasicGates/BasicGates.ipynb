    "\n",
    "**Basic Gates** quantum kata is a series of exercises designed\n",
    "to get you familiar with the basic quantum gates in Q#.\n",
    "It covers the following topics:\n",
    "* basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates,\n",
    "* adjoint and controlled gates,\n",
    "* using gates to modify the state of a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.\n",
    "Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment)\n",
    "with some Q# code to make the failing test pass. To try your answer run the cell with Ctrl/⌘+Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tasks can be done using exactly one gate.\n",
    "None of the tasks require measurement, and the tests are written so as to fail if qubit state is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are given in approximate order of increasing difficulty; harder ones are marked with asterisks.\n"
